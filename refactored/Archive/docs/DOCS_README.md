## Token Efficiency Tips

1. **Always start with START_HERE_TOMORROW.md** - It's concise (103 lines vs 291 lines before)
2. **Only read SESSION_SUMMARY.md if you need deep technical context**
3. **Avoid reading Archive/ directory** - Historical content only
4. **Reference docs by link** - Don't read entire files unless necessary
