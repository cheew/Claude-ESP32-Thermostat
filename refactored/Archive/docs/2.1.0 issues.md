Ver 2.1.0 notes/issues
	1. Scheduling not working, nothing shown just drop down box to select output. .

	2. Add sliders to all target temps in outputs (15 - 35) safe zone with tick box to override safe working temps, log to be notified.


	3. Dark mode
		Button different height to settings button.
		Most boxes are similar contrast to test making it hard to read when dark mode on.

	4. Is home assistant discovery message send by mqtt? As not seeing new device show uo in HA.
	5. Auto update sees newer version but fails to update
	6. Need an item in outputs  sensor  drop down "No sensor" and "humidity" 
		a. No sensor is for basic scheduled control of foggers or misters or just lights. When this is selected the target temp disappears and only schedule or manual shows
		b. If humidity is selected the the target temp changes to trget humidity etc (We will add humidity soon but lets sort these outputs selection now. 
	7.Add current time to header somewhere readable for every page.
	8. in Schedule, it used to have next scheduled change, it seems to heve gone?
	9. this text in dark mde, cannot be seen :
